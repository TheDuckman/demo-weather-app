# Weather App (Portfolio Project)

This project was built by me, Gabriel Pato, to check my Vue.js 3 skills. All weather data is obtained from [the Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

## ✨ Features

- Lists sample cities
- Fetches current and forecast data for the selected city
- Displays 5 day forecast and 5 hour forecast
- Responsive interface (mobile/desktop)

## 🛠️ Tech

The app was built using Vue.js version 3 (and using the composition API). Other technologies that were used are listed here:

- Pinia (store)
- Axios (HTTP requests)
- Bootstrap (layout)
- TypeScript (typing)
